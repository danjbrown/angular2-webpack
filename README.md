# angular2-webpack

An Angular2 starter application with integrated Bootstrap Dashboard template.

Key Features:

* Written in TypeScript.
* Now includes tslint, a static analysis linter for TypeSript.
* Includes working examples of routing, shared services, event emitters and filters.
* Uses webpack-dev-server which builds and reloads the app in the browser when a change is detected, making development faster.
