# angular2-webpack
An Angular2 starter, using the module bundler Webpack and a Bootstrap Dashboard template.

The app is written in TypeScript and includes examples for routing, shared services and filters.

You will see that the jQuery and Bootstrap resources are loaded in vendor.js

Webpack includes webpack-dev-server that builds and reloads the app in the browser when a change is detected, making development easier.

Install
```
npm install
```

Start the app using Webpack
```
npm start
```

Run the tests
```
npm test
```
